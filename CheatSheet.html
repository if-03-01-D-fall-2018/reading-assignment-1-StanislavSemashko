<h1>CheatSheet</h1>



<h3>World Wide Web General!</h3>



<p><u>1988: </u><p>
<p>The first direct IP connection between Europe and North America was made.<p>

<p><u>1989: </u><p>
<p> A proposal for a System called Mesh which described a more elaberate information management based on links in a readable text/hyperlinks <p>

<p><u>1990: </u><p>
<p>Hypertextproject called WorldWideWeb as a web of hypertext documents which are viewed by browsers. <p>

<p><u>1993: </u><p>
<p>The World Wide Web got free to anyone and the Mosaic Webbrowser was released. <p>
<p>(WorldWideWeb != Internet)<p>

<p><u>Reasons why the World Wide Web was such a success:</u><p>
<p>The Internet and Hypertext were married for the first time. Also these three technologies were essential for the development of the World Wide Web.
The URL (uniform resource locator) and URI(uniform resource identifier), or former UDI (universal document identifier) is a system for (globally) unique identifiers for resources on the Web.<p>

<p><u>The general components of a url:</u><p>
<p>1. A scheme. The scheme identifies the protocol to be used to access the resource on the Internet. It can be HTTP (without SSL) or HTTPS (with SSL).<p>
<p>2. A host. The host name identifies the host that holds the resource. For example, www.example.com.<p>
<p>3. A path. The path identifies the specific resource within the host that the Web client wants to access. For example, /software/htp/cics/index.html.<p>
<p>HTML... Hypertext Markup Language<p>
<p>HTTP...Hypertext Transfer Protocol<p>
<p><u>How resources (html pages, images, etc) addressed in the web:</u><p>
<p><p>The Web is an information space containing hyperlinked documents and other resources, identified by their URIs.It is implemented as both client and server software using Internet protocols such as TCP/IP and HTTP.

<h3>Web Server!</h3>

<p><u>What is a web server:</u><p>
<p>A webserver shall store, process and deliver webpages to clients. The communication between the server and the client takes place using http. Mostly delivered are HTML Documents.<p>

<p><u>What does a web server:</u><p>
<p>For serving the World Wide Web. They can also be found embedded in devices such as printers, routers, webcams and serving only a local network.<p>
<p>A web browser or a web crawler starts to communicate by making a request for a specific resource using HTTP or HTTPS. The server responds with the resource or an error.<p>

<p><u>How can content be stored on a web server:</u><p>
<p>While the primary function is to serve content, a full implementation of HTTP also includes ways of receiving content from clients. This feature is used for submitting web forms, including uploading of files.
<p>
<p><u>How is content in webpages described:</u><p>
<p>Many generic web servers also support server-side scripting using Active Server Pages (ASP), PHP, or other scripting languages.<p>

<h3>Web Client!</h3>

<p><u>What is a web client:</u><p>
<p>Also known as Web Browser, a web client is an application for accessing information on the world wide web.<p>

<p><u>What does a web client:</u><p>
<p> It fetches information resources and displays them to an end device like a computer.<p>

<p>The process is the following: The user inputs a URL, the rendering engine of the browser renders it and then displays it. <p>

<h3>Hello World!</h3>
<p><u>Doctype:</u><p>
<p>The &lt!DOCTYPE&gt on the head of a html document exists to show the browser the version of html that is used. It's not always required but you should still use it always.<p>

<p><u>Body element:</u><p>
<p>The &ltbody&gt element contains all of the contents such as text, images and other.<p>

<p><u> em element:</u><p>
<p>The &ltem&gt tag is used to show important text that should be higlighted from the rest of the text<p>

<p><u>Head element:</u><p>
<p>The &lthead&gt element contains all of the metadata and things like the &ltstyle&gt tag, the &ltscript&gt tag or the &ltlink&gt tag.<p>

<p><u> html tag:</u><p>
<p>The &lthtml&gt element shows the browser that the following document is a html document. It also is the root for all of the other tags and elements of the html document.<p>

<p><u>strong element:</u><p>
<p>The &ltstrong&gt exists for basically the same reason as the &ltem&gt tag. It just has a other style, it's kinda bold, which is also very useful sometimes.<p>

<p><u>title element:</u><p>
<p>The &lttitle&gt element is required in a html document, it is basically just the title of the document. It is between the &lthead&gt tags.<p>
